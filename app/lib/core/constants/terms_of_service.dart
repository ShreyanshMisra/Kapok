Kapok Terms of Service Agreement

Welcome to Kapok

Kapok is a volunteer coordination platform designed to assist in organizing disaster relief efforts. Kapok is managed and operated by the National Center for Technology and Dispute Resolution ("NCTDR") and was developed in collaboration with BUILD UMass. By using Kapok, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms").

1. Acceptance of Terms

By creating an account or otherwise accessing or using the Kapok app, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please refrain from using Kapok.

2. User Responsibilities and Eligibility

2.1 Eligibility
Kapok is intended solely for users who are at least 18 years old. By using the app, you represent that you meet this eligibility requirement.

2.2 Account Security
Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials. Any activities performed under your account are solely your responsibility.

2.3 Appropriate Use
Users agree to use Kapok solely for volunteer coordination in disaster relief settings and in compliance with all local laws and regulations. Unauthorized use of Kapok for illegal or harmful activities is strictly prohibited.

3. Disclaimer of Warranties

Kapok is provided "as-is" and "as available," with no warranties of any kind. NCTDR and BUILD UMass disclaim any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to the app's suitability for a specific purpose, functionality in offline environments, or non-infringement.

Kapok depends on external services like Firebase and MapBox; we do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to the app. Users acknowledge that features like offline-first capabilities may be limited by external conditions or third-party service availability.

4. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

• NCTDR, BUILD UMass, and their affiliates are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use Kapok.

• Users accept responsibility for risks associated with volunteer coordination, including personal safety and task execution. Kapok is a coordination tool only and does not assume responsibility for outcomes related to user activities, decisions, or actions taken as a result of app use.

5. User Data and Privacy

5.1 Data Collection
Kapok may collect data, including account information and task details, for operational purposes. Information is stored on Firebase, which adheres to privacy and security standards but may be subject to third-party risks.

5.2 Offline Data
Users understand and agree that data collected offline is stored locally on their device until an internet connection is available to synchronize it with our servers. NCTDR and BUILD UMass are not responsible for data loss or corruption during this synchronization process.

5.3 Personal Data Security
NCTDR prioritizes data security; however, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Users acknowledge and accept the inherent security risks.

6. Intellectual Property

All content, trademarks, and logos associated with Kapok, including but not limited to the Kapok tree logo, are the property of NCTDR. Users are granted a limited license to use the app for its intended purpose only.

7. Modifications to Terms

NCTDR may modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of Kapok following such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
